h2. The `dbscripts_on_*` tables

The manual reference for these tables is located in the "doc/script_commands.txt":https://github.com/cmangos/mangos-wotlk/blob/master/doc/script_commands.txt file.

*The information below may be outdated, use with caution!*


This table format is used for different tables to control possible scripts activated by different actions:

* *`dbscripts_on_go_[template]_use:* Holds possible scripts activated by gameobjects.
    Source: object user (unit); Target: gameobject.
    ** dbscripts_on_go_template_use can be used for any type of gameobject.
    ** dbscripts_on_go_use can be used only for GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_DOOR (0) and GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_BUTTON (1)

* *`dbscripts_on_spell:* Holds scripts that can be activated by spells with the following spell effects:
    ** SPELL_EFFECT_DUMMY (3)
    ** SPELL_EFFECT_TRIGGER_SPELL (64) - only for missing triggered spells
    ** SPELL_EFFECT_SCRIPT_EFFECT (77)
    Source: caster; Target: target.

* *`dbscripts_on_relay:* Holds scripts that can be activated by AI or other dbscripts. The usage of IDs is as following:
    ** Classic - 1-9999
    ** TBC     - 10000-19999
    ** WotLK   - 20000+
    Source and Target are defined by the mechanism that launched it.

* *`dbscripts_on_quest_start:* Holds scripts activated when a player accepts a quest.
    Source: quest giver (creature); Target: player; Script execution unique by source.

* *`dbscripts_on_quest_end:* Holds scripts activated when a player finishes a quest.
    Source: quest taker (creature); Target: player; Script execution unique by source.

* *`dbscripts_on_creature_movement:* Holds scripts activated while a npc is moving.
    Source: moving creature; Target moving creature.

* *`dbscripts_on_creature_death:* Holds scripts activated when a creature dies.
    Source: killed creature; Target: responsible killer (unit or player).

* *`dbscripts_on_event:* Holds scripts activated whenever an event is activated by spell, gameobject or taxi waypoints. The following spell effects and gameobjects can activate an event:
    ** SPELL_EFFECT_SEND_EVENT (61)
    ** GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_CHEST (3)
    ** GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_GOOBER (10)
    ** GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_TRANSPORT (11) [not supported yet]
    ** GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_CAMERA (13)
    ** GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_MO_TRANSPORT (15) [partially supported]
    ** GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_FLAGDROP (26) [not supported yet]
    ** GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_CAPTURE_POINT (29)
    ** GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_DESTRUCTIBLE_BUILDING (33)
    Source, Target and Script execution can be different based on the event activation source.

* *`dbscripts_on_gossip:* Holds scripts activated on gossip_menu_option or gossip_menu.
    ** For gossip_menu - Source: player; Target: gossip holder (creature or gameobject); Script execution unique by target.
    ** For gossip_menu_option when gossip holder is creature - Source: gossip holder (creature); Target: player; Script execution unique by source.
    ** For gossip_menu_option when gossip holder is gameobject - Source: player; Target: gossip holder (gameobject); Script execution unique by target.

NOTE: An entry in this table may have more than one row as a script may do more than just one action. Also each action the script may make can have a separate "delay":dbscripts#delay attached to it. In that case, the core will activate the appropriate action after the correct "delay":dbscripts#delay.

h3. Description of the fields

h4. id

For *dbscripts_on_creature_death*, it is the entry of the creature. See "creature_template.entry":creature_template#entry.
For *dbscripts_on_creature_movement*, it is the "script id":Creature_movement#script_id of the waypoint. The PROPER formatting for the ID field is as follows: Creature_entry + 2-Digit Script ID (Starting at 01). Example: c.2386 has few movement_scripts, so 2386+01 = 238601 ... 23602 ..etc
For *dbscripts_on_event*, it is the event ID. There doesn't exist currently a full list of events. In any case, the event IDs are taken directly from gameobject WDB data or spell effect data. If both a gameobject and a spell activate the same event, the IDs will match.
For *dbscripts_on_go_template_use*, it is the entry of the button/lever. See "gameobject_template.entry":gameobject_template#entry.
For *dbscripts_on_go_use*, it is the guid of the button/lever. See "gameobject.guid":gameobject#guid.
For *dbscripts_on_gossip*, it is the "action script id":Gossip_menu_option#action_script_id of the gossip option.
For *dbscripts_on_promo_code_use*, it is the ?
For *dbscripts_on_quest_end*, it is the ID that is used in "CompleteScript":quest_template#CompleteScript in the quest template definition.
For *dbscripts_on_quest_start*, it is the ID that is used in "StartScript":quest_template#StartScript in the quest template definition.
For *dbscripts_on_relay*, it is unique ID (0-9999 for Classic, 10k-19999 for TBC, 20K+ for WoTLK)
For *dbscripts_on_spell*, it is the Spell ID. See "spell_template.Id":spell_template#Id

h4. delay

Delay in milliseconds before this current step of the script activates. 0 = instant.

NOTE: Delay is Cumulative From Script to Script with same ID.
Example: Script 1 Has 5 seconds (5000ms) delay and then if you want script 2 to trigger 3 seconds (3000ms) later you would use delay value 8000 (5000+3000) for script 2 in the sequence.

The type of action performed by the script after "delay":dbscripts#delay milliseconds have passed. The value of this field affects what other fields also need to be set.

h4. buddy_entry

Commands except the ones requiring a player (like KILL_CREDIT) have support for the buddy concept. 

This means that if an entry for buddy_entry is provided, aside from source and target as listed above also a "buddy" is available.

Which one on the three (originalSource, originalTarget, buddy) will be used in the "command":dbscripts#command, depends on the "data_flags":dbscripts#data_flags (enum ScriptInfoDataFlags) Note that some commands (like EMOTE) use only the resulting source for an action.

Possible combinations of the "data_flags":dbscripts#data_flags |SCRIPT_FLAG_BUDDY_AS_TARGET 0x01|SCRIPT_FLAG_REVERSE_DIRECTION 0x02|SCRIPT_FLAG_SOURCE_TARGETS_SELF 0x04| are:

Where "A -> B" means that the "command":dbscripts#command is executed from A with B as target.

|Hex|A -> B|
|0x00|originalSource / buddyIfProvided -> originalTarget|
|0x01|originalSource -> buddy|
|0x02|originalTarget -> originalSource / buddyIfProvided|
|0x03|buddy -> originalSource|
|0x04|originalSource / buddyIfProvided -> originalSource / buddyIfProvided|
|0x05|originalSource -> originalSource|
|0x06|originalTarget -> originalTarget|
|0x07|buddy -> buddy|
