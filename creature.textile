h3. Description of the fields

h4. guid

h4. modelid

The model ID associated with this creature. Note that two creatures that use the same template can have different models. See "creature_model_info":creature_model_info for more information on model-specific characteristics. DEPRECATED: Use creature_spawn_data_template paradigm instead.

h4. equipment_id

The ID of the equipment that the creature is using. See "creature_equip_template.entry":creature_equip_template#entry DEPRECATED: Use creature_spawn_data_template paradigm instead.

h4. position_y

The Y position of the creature.

h4. position_z

The Z position of the creature.

h4. orientation

The orientation of the creature. (North = 0.0; South = pi (3.14159))

h4. spawntimesecsmin

The minimum respawn time of the creature in seconds. 

h4. spawntimesecsmax

The maximum respawn time of the creature in seconds. 

If both spawntimesecsmin and spawntimesecsmax are 0, creature will not respawn. only scripted respawn

h4. spawndist

The maximum distance that the creature should spawn from its spawn point. Also controls how far away the creature can walk from its spawn point if its "MovementType":creature#MovementType = 1.

|_. Value|_. Comment|
|1|Orientation change only|
|2|Lowest random movement value|
|5|Default random movement value|

h4. currentwaypoint

The current waypoint number that the creature is on, if any. See "creature_movement.point":creature_movement#point

h4. curhealth
