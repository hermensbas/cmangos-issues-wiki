h2. EventAI Guide

ScriptDev2 was integrated into cmangos on 04 sept 2015 and enables us to handle DB-based scripting that allows the use of a database (MySQL only right now) to specify the actions that a creature script will do.

The script is called EventAI and will be referenced like this for the rest of this guide. A basic EventAI script works with and requires only two pieces of information: <u>When it happens</u> and <u>What happens when</u>. 

The first piece of information (the <u>When it happens</u>) will be referred to as the <u>event</u>.

The second piece of information (the <u>What happens when</u>) will be referred to as the <u>action</u>. 
Currently, a single EventAI script entry can have up to three actions.

Anyone that wants to create entries for the EventAI script needs to answer the two questions above.

Some events will only occur once while others can be timed so that they occur at a specified interval.

Example:

let's say that a certain creature using EventAI will have a max of four phases. We are then dealing with a 4 bit number in this field. Let's further say that that certain creature has an event that will only trigger in its phase 2 (a timed spell cast for instance). Then the field should contain all of the phases the event SHOULDN'T be triggered in...then out of the four bits, we leave the *third* bit alone (off) and turn on all of the other bits so we get 1011 which is equal to 11, so we put in 11 as the inverse phase mask for the event entry. As another example, let's say that the same creature previously mentioned has another event that is only triggered in the phase 0 and phase 3. This would mean that we need to ignore phase 1 and 2, so our bitmask would be 0110 which is equal to 6 so we put in 6 for this event's inverse phase mask field. Please note that both examples were tailored for a creature with four and only four phases. If you decide to add more phases later on, you will have to redefine all of the nonzero bitmasks for all of the mob's events.

EventAI can also support phases. A <u>phase</u> is just a way to group certain events + actions together so that the creature will perform certain actions based on what event it is currently on. The way the phase system works in EventAI is that for every event added, it needs to be specified under which phases the event <u>SHOULD NOT</u> occur. This is a bit confusing at first, so let's look at it more closely. A creature can have more than one phase, up to a max of 32 different phases (with the first one being phase 0, and last one being phase 31). How the phase selection field works is that it contains a 32bit number. Each bit in the number represents a possible phase, with the bit in the least significant position signifying phase 0 and the most significant bit signifying phase 31. The default value of zero in this field has no bits set and since the field controls when the event should NOT trigger, it would then mean that the event will always be triggered independent of the current phase the creature is in. Therefore, if you want to specify what phases the event should occur in, you need to add up all of the corresponding bits for all the other phases where the event shouldn't trigger in (confusing...yes).

All of the "events":creature_ai_scripts#event_type, "EventFlags":creature_ai_scripts#EventFlags, "actions":creature_ai_scripts#action_type and possible "targets":creature_ai_scripts#Target are summarized and described below.

Now that all of the supported events have been listed and described, we shall now move on to the actions that can be performed. 

Each event can take up to three actions. The actions will all be performed when the event is triggered and they will be performed in the order that they have been defined. This means that, for a certain event, action 1 will be performed first, followed by action 2, then lastly by action 3.

Just like event definitions, each action can use up to three different parameters but not all actions will use all three parameters. If a parameter isn't mentioned for an action, then that action does not need that parameter.

The ranged mode was designed to be toggled on spawn, but can effectively by toggled on phase change on other condition when needed. It automatically reverts itself on evade. It works in connection with its modes, and automatically changes chase distance. A main casting spell, which is supposed to be lowest in priority (highest ID), needs to use 256 cast flag. This notes that when this spell returns OOM error, ranged mode automatically adjusts its behaviour. Ranged mode also responds to kicks and silence on this spell. Last notable feature with ranged mode is distancing, which only occurs if cast flag 1024 is set, and when creature is in melee mode, and the target is hit, creature runs away from main aggro targets melee reach.
