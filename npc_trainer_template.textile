Back to "world database":mangosdb_struct list of tables.

h2. The `npc_trainer(_template)` table

This table holds all the information on training NPCs. All spells listed in the table are learning spells. This means that the main effect of the spells listed here is to teach spells to the target (which is the player in this case). Any other spell that is not a learning spell will be ignored and an error message will be shown in the console window. Learning spells usually have the same name as their actual spell counterparts and are listed as Uncategorized in Wowhead.
