## About Git:

From the [official page][git-scm-home]:
> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

CMaNGOS uses Git as it's primary source code version control system.

Please, take your time and make yourself familiar with it.

## How To Git:
**1.** The [Git Book][git-book]:

  This book should be your first step. It will introduce you to basics ([Ch. 1, 2][git-book-start]) you'll need to interact with our repositories, will explain branching ([Ch. 3][git-book-ch3]), and even explain how to work with GitHub ([Ch. 6][git-book-ch6]).

**2.** Tips on [good commit messages][tbaggery-git]:

  You are encoraged to read these, as they explain how to describe your commits in a meaningful, useful way.

**3.** [Git Best Practices][best-practices]:

  Collection of every single thing that's going wrong / being misunderstood about git and how to turn the tides.
After this step you should be fairly ready to go just about any Git task.

Should you have further questions, read the rest of [Git Book][git-book] and search around [Stack Overflow][stack-overflow-git-start].
